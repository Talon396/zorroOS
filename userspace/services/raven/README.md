# Raven Compositor
The Raven Compositor is zorroOS's compositor.
It it built in mind for networking while also allowing for software to take advantage of direct control of surfaces when ran on the same machine.
The Raven Compositor uses ideas from both the X Window Manager and Wayland to create a new compositor API.
